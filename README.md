# Machine Learning-
There are 4 types of machine learning 
Superviised machine learning.
Unsupervised Machine Learning
Semi-supervised machine learning
Reinforcement machine Leaning

# Supervised Machine Learning has 2 types
#Regression and classification
#Regression
1-Simple Linear Regression
It has only one feature and only one target.
In simple linear Regression we observed prediction of training and testing dat
using scatterplot and line plot.


#Multiple Linear regression
In Multiple Linear regession there are more than two features present 
we did prediction on that using sklearn library and 
# Features selection -
this technique is use to select important or significant features so that we get more accuracy
